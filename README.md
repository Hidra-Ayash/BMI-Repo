 what is BMI?
 Body Mass Index (BMI) is a medical screening tool used by healthcare providers 
 to estimate the amount of body fat in an individual. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms (kg) 
 by the square of their height in meters (m²). Although BMI correlates with body fat in most cases, 
 it’s essential to recognize that it’s not always an accurate representation of body fatness.
